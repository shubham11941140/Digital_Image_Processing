# Refer to Q1.ipynb for assumptions, code documentation and implementation of the function.
# There is a section which is used to invoke the functions for testing purposes. You can change the parameters as you wish for manual test cases within the Q1.ipynb file.

# Parameters : (Manual Testing)
# mat=image matrix containing intensity values
# p=start point
# q=end point
# V=set of intensities for which the path should be extracted
# adj=type of path requested by the user where I have defined adj1 for 4-path, adj2 for 8-path and adj3 for m-path.

# There are some examples given within the IPYNB that deal with the changing of parameters. You can change the parameters with your input and run it.

# Ensure the arguments that you pass to the function are in the correct order and are valid and of the correct type.
# Otherwise the program will throw an error and exit.
